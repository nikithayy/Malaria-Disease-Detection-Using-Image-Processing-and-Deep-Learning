# Malaria-Disease-Detection-Using-Image-Processing-and-Deep-Learning
This project uses image processing and deep learning, specifically CNNs and VGG-19, to detect malaria-infected cells in blood smears. Trained on 5,000+ images, it achieves 95% accuracy, offering a fast, reliable, and cost-effective solution that reduces reliance on manual microscopy in resource-limited areas.
